### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
**Glad to see you here!** :star_struck: <br> The green dots on my [**GitHub** profile](https://github.com/delta94?tab=repositories) represent my journey :running_man: - From **being curious** with *PHP* to *Laravel* and Now I'm focusing to React Native and I was starting to love React Native along with interesting animation, beautiful UI,.. so I decided to spend a lot of time on learning React, React Native and Typescript.
